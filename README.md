# Snippets for VSCode <!-- omit in toc -->

Code snippets are great additions to anyone who wants to save time while developing. They make it easier to enter repeating code, such as loops, complex HTML structures or reusable methods.

Visual Studio Code already has great support for snippets, including snippets appearance in IntelliSense `(Ctrl+Space)`, tab-completion, as well as a dedicated snippet picker `(Insert Snippet in the Command Palette)`.

This extension takes snippets to another level bringing new features which will improve managing code snippets.
